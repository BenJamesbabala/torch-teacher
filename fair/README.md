## The Goldilocks Principle: Reading Children's Books with Explicit Memory Representations (ICLR 2016)

[Torch](http://torch.ch) implementation of the model 'MemNNs (Window Memory + Self-Supervision)' proposed in [Hill et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02301)'s work.

### Features

* Train the model with the benchmarked corpus, [Children's Book Tes]t(https://research.facebook.com/research/babi/) out of the box.
* Support for the selection of window composition, viz., Summation or Concatentation of the word vectors within the window
* Support for tuning other hyper-parameters of the model reported in the paper.
